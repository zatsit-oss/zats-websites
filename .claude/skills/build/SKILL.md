description: Run the production build for one of the monorepo projects (corporate or sustainability-portal)
---

This is a monorepo — there is **no `package.json` at the root**. You must `cd` into a project before running `npm run build`.

## Corporate

```bash
cd corporate && npm run build
```

Output: `corporate/dist/`.

## Sustainability Portal

```bash
cd sustainability-portal && npm run build
```

Output: `sustainability-portal/dist/`.

## Notes

- Fix any TypeScript or Astro errors before re-running.
- Preview the production build locally with `npm run preview` from the same project directory.
- Both projects are deployed to Firebase Hosting (see `firebase.json` in each project).
