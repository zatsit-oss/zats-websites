## Features

- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Light/dark theme with localStorage persistence
- Eco-design (minimal JavaScript, optimized CSS, self-hosted fonts)
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast)
- Typed environment variables
- Machine-readable head and discoverability files (see below)

## Discoverability

Three files are emitted at build so search engines and answer engines can find and describe the site:

| Path | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/robots.txt` | `public/robots.txt` | open to every crawler, declares the sitemap, **no per-agent rules** |
| `/sitemap.xml` | `src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts` | the literal path scanners look for, not `sitemap-index.xml` |
| `/llms.txt` | `src/pages/llms.txt.ts` | Markdown summary of the site, one line per page |

The sitemap and `llms.txt` build their page list from `getIndexablePages()`, so a page hidden through `DISABLED_PAGES` is never advertised. `@astrojs/sitemap` is deliberately not used: it builds from Astro's routes, and the disabled pages are deleted afterwards in `astro:build:done`, so it would publish URLs that 404.

Every page also carries a canonical URL, Open Graph and Twitter tags, and a JSON-LD graph. See `corporate/CLAUDE.md` for the head contract and `zats-blog/REFERENCEMENT.md` for the reasoning across all four sites, including what we refuse to add.

## Environment Variables

Defined in `astro.config.mjs` with default values:

- `SITE_URL`: Main site URL
- `BLOG_URL`: Blog URL
- `LINKEDIN_URL`: LinkedIn page URL
- `GITHUB_URL`: GitHub organization URL
- `SUSTAINABILITY_URL`: Sustainability portal URL

### Conditional Page Generation

Use `DISABLED_PAGES` at build time to exclude specific pages from the generated output.

```bash
# Disable a single page
DISABLED_PAGES=careers npm run build

# Disable multiple pages (comma-separated slugs)
DISABLED_PAGES="careers,find-us,join-us" npm run build
```

**Controllable pages:** `careers`, `find-us`, `join-us`, `team`, `tech`, `work-with-us`

**Always generated (cannot be disabled):** `index` (home), `legal-notice`, `privacy-policy`

When a page is disabled:
- Its HTML file is removed from `dist/` after build → returns 404
- All navigation links and CTAs pointing to it are hidden from the generated HTML

## Redirects

The WordPress site that `zatsit.fr` served until 2026-09-03 exposed a handful of French URLs. They are kept alive as permanent redirects so inbound links and search results do not break.

**These redirects are not part of this Astro project.** They live in the production load balancer, which answers them before any request reaches the bucket: url map `wordpress-lb`, path matcher `zatsit-website-prod-v1`, in the GCP project `sites-web-407116`.

| Legacy URL | Redirects to | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `/contact/` and `/contact` | `/work-with-us/` | 301 |
| `/collaborer-avec-zatsit/` and `/collaborer-avec-zatsit` | `/work-with-us/` | 301 |
| `/mentions-legales/` and `/mentions-legales` | `/legal-notice/` | 301 |

The host is preserved: `www.zatsit.fr/contact/` redirects to `www.zatsit.fr/work-with-us/`.

Two related behaviours, also served by the infrastructure rather than by the build:

- **Trailing slashes.** Every internal link this project emits ends with a slash, and `astro.config.mjs` sets `trailingSlash: 'always'`. A request without the slash gets a `301` to the slash form from the bucket website configuration, so internal navigation never pays that redirect.
- **404.** `src/pages/404.astro` is emitted as `dist/404.html`, which the production bucket declares as its `notFoundPage`. Unknown URLs, and pages excluded through `DISABLED_PAGES`, therefore return a real `404` with our own page.

### Adding a redirect

Redirects are `routeRules` on the path matcher, at priorities `1` and up. The rule that rewrites `/{page=*}/` to `/{page}/index.html` sits at priority `100` and must stay below them, otherwise it swallows the redirect paths first.

```bash
gcloud compute url-maps export wordpress-lb --project=sites-web-407116 --destination=urlmap.yaml
# edit urlmap.yaml, then
gcloud compute url-maps import wordpress-lb --project=sites-web-407116 --source=urlmap.yaml
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache wordpress-lb --path="/*" --project=sites-web-407116
```

A url map change takes several minutes to reach the edge, while the API already reads back the new configuration. Poll the URL rather than re-importing.
